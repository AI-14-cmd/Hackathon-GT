Why We Chose This Project

In the AdTech world, account managers and analysts spend hours every week downloading CSV files, cleaning data, and manually building performance reports for clients. This process is slow, repetitive, and error-prone, even though the underlying data is already digital.

We chose this project because we wanted to solve a real-world business pain point — automating the entire reporting workflow using data engineering and AI.

Our goal was to create a system that can:

Ingest raw data from multiple sources (CSV, SQL, APIs),

Process & Analyze it automatically to generate key insights, and

Produce a ready-to-share, executive-level PDF/PPT report — complete with AI-generated summaries and charts — all with zero manual work.

This project stands out because it:

💡 Turns a manual process into an automated AI-driven workflow

⚙️ Combines data engineering with natural language generation (LLM)

📊 Focuses on business usability — the final deliverable is not just a dashboard but a beautiful, client-ready document

🚀 Is scalable, meaning once set up, it can generate reports for multiple clients in parallel with no extra effort

By blending automation, analytics, and AI storytelling, our project demonstrates how data pipelines can directly drive business efficiency and decision-making.
